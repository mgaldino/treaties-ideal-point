Phase 1 — R Integration for 3 New Issue Areas
================================================
Date: 2026-02-03
Status: SUCCESS
Plan: docs/new_sources_plan.md (Phase 1)

Script: scripts/R/01_prepare_data.R

Changes made:
  1. Added build_un_hr_treaties() — reads un_hr_ratifications.csv, maps ISO3,
     creates events and items for issue_area = "human_rights"
  2. Added build_arms_control() — reads arms_control_ratifications.csv, maps ISO3,
     creates events and items for issue_area = "arms_control"
  3. Added build_wipo_treaties() — reads wipo_ratifications.csv, maps ISO3,
     uses action_date with entry_into_force_date fallback,
     creates events and items for issue_area = "intellectual_property"
  4. Wired all 3 into all_events/all_items bind_rows
  5. Updated issue_areas vector to include 7 areas

Flow matrix outputs:

Baseline events by issue area:
  environment:            48,679
  investment:              7,457
  trade:                   2,572
  security:                2,447
  human_rights:            1,769  (NEW)
  intellectual_property:   1,330  (NEW)
  arms_control:              950  (NEW)

Item codebook counts:
  environment:   6,540
  investment:    4,061
  security:      2,107
  trade:           141
  intellectual_property: 26  (NEW)
  human_rights:         18  (NEW)
  arms_control:         12  (NEW)

Documentation updated:
  - docs/source_registry.md: 3 new source entries + updated taxonomy
  - HANDOFF.md: Phase 14 entry for data acquisition

Notes:
  - Fixed NA indexing issue in build_wipo_treaties() for best_date assignment
  - ATOP many-to-many join warning is expected (documented in earlier phases)
  - All existing flow matrices (trade, investment, security, environment)
    unchanged — the script regenerates them identically

Next step: Phase 2 — EDA (update 02_eda.R, run PCA on new areas, STOP for user review)
